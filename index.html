			A long, long time ago I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. 
			And I know if I had the chance, then I could make those people dance 
			then maybe they'd be happy for a while. But February made me shiver, and with every 
			paper delivered bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step. I can't remember 
			if I cried when I read about his widowed bride, but something touched me deep inside 
			the day the music died.

			So bye, bye miss American pie. Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry. 
			And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye, singing this'll be the day 
			that I die, this'll be the day that I die.
